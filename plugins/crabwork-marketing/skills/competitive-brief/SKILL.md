Research competitors and generate a structured competitive analysis comparing positioning, messaging, content strategy, and market presence.

## Trigger

User runs `/competitive-brief` or asks for a competitive analysis, competitor research, or market comparison.

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user:

2. **Your company/product context** (optional but recommended):

## Research Process

For each competitor, research using web search:

1. **Company website** — homepage messaging, product pages, about page, pricing page
2. **Recent news** — press releases, funding announcements, product launches, partnerships (last 6 months)
3. **Content strategy** — blog topics, resource types, social media presence, webinars, podcasts
4. **Review sites and comparisons** — third-party comparisons, analyst mentions, customer review themes
5. **Job postings** — hiring signals that indicate strategic direction (optional)

## Analysis Frameworks

For the deeper analytical methods behind this brief — value-proposition and narrative analysis, messaging strengths/vulnerabilities, content gap and content-type-coverage methodology, positioning statements and maps, category strategy, and the full sales battlecard structure — read [references/analysis-frameworks.md](references/analysis-frameworks.md). Pull from it when comparing messaging, mapping content gaps, defining positioning, or building a battlecard.

## Output

Present the full competitive brief with clear formatting. Note the date of the research so the user knows the freshness of the data.

After the brief, ask:

"Would you like me to:
- Create a battlecard for your sales team based on this analysis?
- Draft messaging that exploits the positioning gaps identified?
- Dive deeper into any specific competitor?
- Set up a competitive monitoring plan?"

## Research Escalation Path
<!-- capability-route: deep-research=pending(general deep-research plugin is in planning; see docs/capability-routing.json) -->

- The competitor research above is bounded by the sources reachable in-session. For deeper, systematic multi-source monitoring, ask the user to supply source material, or run the searches in a session equipped with WebSearch/WebFetch tools, and always date-stamp findings so their freshness is clear.
- When a general deep-research plugin ships, this section switches to a fully-qualified route; until then lint:refs tracks the pending marker.
