name: 利益相关方更新
short-description: 把产品进展、决策、风险和下一步整理为清晰沟通
description: Drafts a stakeholder update tailored to audience and cadence. Use when writing a weekly or monthly status report or progress update for leadership, exec, board, or cross-functional partners, announcing a launch, escalating a risk or blocker, setting a Green/Yellow/Red status, writing an ADR or decision doc, or translating the same progress into exec-brief, engineering-detail, or customer-facing versions. Triggers on "write a status update", "draft the weekly update", "summarize progress for leadership", or "I need to tell stakeholders about X".

# Stakeholder Update

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

Generate a stakeholder update tailored to the audience and cadence.

## Usage

```
/stakeholder-update $ARGUMENTS
```

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Update Type

Ask the user what kind of update:
- **Weekly**: Regular cadence update on progress, blockers, and next steps
- **Monthly**: Higher-level summary with trends, milestones, and strategic alignment
- **Launch**: Announcement of a feature or product launch with details and impact
- **Ad-hoc**: One-off update for a specific situation (escalation, pivot, major decision)

### 2. Determine Audience

Ask who the update is for:
- **Executives / leadership**: High-level, outcome-focused, strategic framing, brief
- **Engineering team**: Technical detail, implementation context, blockers, decisions needed
- **Cross-functional partners**: Context-appropriate detail, focus on shared goals and dependencies
- **Customers / external**: Benefits-focused, clear timelines, no internal jargon
- **Board**: Metrics-driven, strategic, risk-focused, very concise

### 3. Pull Context from Connected Tools

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Pull status of roadmap items and milestones
- Identify completed items since last update
- Surface items that are at risk or blocked
- Pull sprint or iteration progress

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Search for relevant team discussions and decisions
- Find blockers or issues raised in channels
- Identify key decisions made asynchronously

If **~~meeting transcription** is connected:
- Pull recent meeting notes and discussion summaries
- Find decisions and action items from relevant meetings

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for recent meeting notes
- Find decision documents or design reviews

If no tools are connected, ask the user to provide:
- What was accomplished since the last update
- Current blockers or risks
- Key decisions made or needed
- What is coming next

### 4. Generate the Update

Structure the update for the target audience using the templates below. For status colors, risk communication, decision records, and meeting facilitation, see [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md).

**For executives**: TL;DR, status color (G/Y/R), key progress tied to goals, decisions made, risks with mitigation, specific asks, and next milestones. Keep it under 300 words.

**For engineering**: What shipped (with links), what is in progress (with owners), blockers, decisions needed (with options and recommendation), and what is coming next.

**For cross-functional partners**: What is coming that affects them, what you need from them (with deadlines), decisions that impact their team, and areas open for input.

**For customers**: What is new (framed as benefits), what is coming soon, known issues with workarounds, and how to provide feedback. No internal jargon.

**For launch announcements**: What launched, why it matters, key details (scope, availability, limitations), success metrics, rollout plan, and feedback channels.

### 5. Review and Deliver

After generating the update:
- Ask if the user wants to adjust tone, detail level, or emphasis
- Offer to format for the delivery channel (email, chat post, doc, slides)
- If **~~chat** is connected, offer to draft the message for sending

## Update Templates by Audience

### Executive / Leadership Update
Executives want: strategic context, progress against goals, risks that need their help, decisions that need their input.

**Format**:
```
Status: [Green / Yellow / Red]

TL;DR: [One sentence — the most important thing to know]

Progress:
- [Outcome achieved, tied to goal/OKR]
- [Milestone reached, with impact]
- [Key metric movement]

Risks:
- [Risk]: [Mitigation plan]. [Ask if needed].

Decisions needed:
- [Decision]: [Options with recommendation]. Need by [date].

Next milestones:
- [Milestone] — [Date]
```

**Tips for executive updates**:
- Lead with the conclusion, not the journey. Executives want "we shipped X and it moved Y metric" not "we had 14 standups and resolved 23 tickets."
- Keep it under 200 words. If they want more, they will ask.
- Status color should reflect YOUR genuine assessment, not what you think they want to hear. Yellow is not a failure — it is good risk management.
- Only include risks you want help with. Do not list risks you are already handling unless they need to know.
- Asks must be specific: "Decision on X by Friday" not "support needed."

### Engineering Team Update
Engineers want: clear priorities, technical context, blockers resolved, decisions that affect their work.

**Format**:
```
Shipped:
- [Feature/fix] — [Link to PR/ticket]. [Impact if notable].

In progress:
- [Item] — [Owner]. [Expected completion]. [Blockers if any].

Decisions:
- [Decision made]: [Rationale]. [Link to ADR if exists].
- [Decision needed]: [Context]. [Options]. [Recommendation].

Priority changes:
- [What changed and why]

Coming up:
- [Next items] — [Context on why these are next]
```

**Tips for engineering updates**:
- Link to specific tickets, PRs, and documents. Engineers want to click through for details.
- When priorities change, explain why. Engineers are more bought in when they understand the reason.
- Be explicit about what is blocking them and what you are doing to unblock it.
- Do not waste their time with information that does not affect their work.

### Cross-Functional Partner Update
Partners (design, marketing, sales, support) want: what is coming that affects them, what they need to prepare for, how to give input.

**Format**:
```
What's coming:
- [Feature/launch] — [Date]. [What this means for your team].

What we need from you:
- [Specific ask] — [Context]. By [date].

Decisions made:
- [Decision] — [How it affects your team].

Open for input:
- [Topic we'd love feedback on] — [How to provide it].
```

### Customer / External Update
Customers want: what is new, what is coming, how it benefits them, how to get started.

**Format**:
```
What's new:
- [Feature] — [Benefit in customer terms]. [How to use it / link].

Coming soon:
- [Feature] — [Expected timing]. [Why it matters to you].

Known issues:
- [Issue] — [Status]. [Workaround if available].

Feedback:
- [How to share feedback or request features]
```

**Tips for customer updates**:
- No internal jargon. No ticket numbers. No technical implementation details.
- Frame everything in terms of what the customer can now DO, not what you built.
- Be honest about timelines but do not overcommit. "Later this quarter" is better than a date you might miss.
- Only mention known issues if they are customer-impacting and you have a resolution plan.

## Reference

When you need them, read [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md):
- **Status Reporting Framework** — what Green/Yellow/Red mean and when to change status
- **Risk Communication** — ROAM framework, how to communicate risks, common mistakes
- **Decision Documentation (ADRs)** — ADR format, when to write one, tips
- **Meeting Facilitation** — running standups, sprint planning, retros, and demos

## Output Format

Keep updates scannable. Use bold for key points, bullets for lists. Executive updates should be under 300 words. Engineering updates can be longer but should still be structured for skimming.

## Tips

- The most common mistake in stakeholder updates is burying the lead. Start with the most important thing.
- Status colors (Green/Yellow/Red) should reflect reality, not optimism. Yellow is not a failure — it is good risk communication.
- Asks should be specific and actionable. "We need help" is not an ask. "We need a decision on X by Friday" is.
- For executives, frame everything in terms of outcomes and goals, not activities and tasks.
- If there is bad news, lead with it. Do not hide it after good news.
- Match the length to the audience's attention. Executives get a few bullets. Engineering gets the details they need.
