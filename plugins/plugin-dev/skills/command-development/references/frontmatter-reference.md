# Command Frontmatter Reference

Complete reference for YAML frontmatter fields in slash commands.

## Frontmatter Overview

YAML frontmatter is optional metadata at the start of command files:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description
allowed-tools: Read, Write
model: inherit
argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2]
---

Command prompt content here...
```

All fields are optional. Commands work without any frontmatter.

## Field Specifications

### description

**Type:** String
**Required:** No
**Default:** First line of command prompt
**Max Length:** ~60 characters recommended for `/help` display

**Purpose:** Describes what the command does, shown in `/help` output

**Examples:**
```yaml
description: Review code for security issues
```
```yaml
description: Deploy to staging environment
```
```yaml
description: Generate API documentation
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep under 60 characters for clean display
- Start with verb (Review, Deploy, Generate)
- Be specific about what command does
- Avoid redundant "command" or "slash command"

**Good:**
- ✅ "Review PR for code quality and security"
- ✅ "Deploy application to specified environment"
- ✅ "Generate comprehensive API documentation"

**Bad:**
- ❌ "This command reviews PRs" (unnecessary "This command")
- ❌ "Review" (too vague)
- ❌ "A command that reviews pull requests for code quality, security issues, and best practices" (too long)

### allowed-tools

**Type:** String or Array of strings
**Required:** No
**Default:** Inherits from conversation permissions

**Purpose:** Restrict or specify which tools command can use

**Formats:**

**Single tool:**
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read
```

**Multiple tools (comma-separated):**
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit
```

**Multiple tools (array):**
```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash(git:*)
```

**Tool Patterns:**

**Specific tools:**
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Edit
```

**Bash with command filter:**
```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)           # Only git commands
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*)           # Only npm commands
allowed-tools: Bash(docker:*)        # Only docker commands
```

**All tools (not recommended):**
```yaml
allowed-tools: "*"
```

**When to use:**

1. **Security:** Restrict command to safe operations
   ```yaml
   allowed-tools: Read, Grep  # Read-only command
   ```

2. **Clarity:** Document required tools
   ```yaml
   allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Read
   ```

3. **Bash execution:** Enable bash command output
   ```yaml
   allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff:*)
   ```

**Best practices:**
- Be as restrictive as possible
- Use command filters for Bash (e.g., `git:*` not `*`)
- Only specify when different from conversation permissions
- Document why specific tools are needed

### model

**Type:** String
**Required:** No
**Default:** Inherits from the conversation
**Values:** `inherit`, the semantic aliases `best` and `planmode`, or a full
model id

**Purpose:** Choose which model executes the command.

Prefer the semantic values. A literal model id is legal, but it pins the
command to one catalog entry: when that entry is retired the pin goes stale,
and a stale pin is worse than no pin because it fails at load rather than
degrading. The semantic values keep meaning across catalog changes.

**Examples:**
```yaml
model: inherit     # Same model as the conversation (equivalent to omitting it)
```
```yaml
model: best        # Ask for the strongest model available
```
```yaml
model: planmode    # The model configured for planning work
```

**When to use:**

**Omit `model` (or use `inherit`) for:**
- Almost every command
- Anything that should respect the user's own model choice
- Commands whose cost profile should match the rest of the session

```yaml
---
description: Format code file
---
```

**Use `best` for:**
- Complex analysis and architectural judgement
- Work where a weaker model's answer would be actively misleading
- Rare, high-stakes commands

```yaml
---
description: Analyze system architecture
model: best
---
```

**Use `planmode` for:**
- Commands that produce a plan rather than perform an edit
- Staying consistent with how the user has configured planning

```yaml
---
description: Draft a migration plan
model: planmode
---
```

**Best practices:**
- Omit unless there is a specific need — inheriting is the right default
- Reach for `best` only where the extra capability changes the outcome
- Do not hard-code a literal model id in a shipped plugin; the user's catalog
  is not yours to assume

### argument-hint

**Type:** String
**Required:** No
**Default:** None

**Purpose:** Document expected arguments for users and autocomplete

**Format:**
```yaml
argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2] [optional-arg]
```

**Examples:**

**Single argument:**
```yaml
argument-hint: [pr-number]
```

**Multiple required arguments:**
```yaml
argument-hint: [environment] [version]
```

**Optional arguments:**
```yaml
argument-hint: [file-path] [options]
```

**Descriptive names:**
```yaml
argument-hint: [source-branch] [target-branch] [commit-message]
```

**Best practices:**
- Use square brackets `[]` for each argument
- Use descriptive names (not `arg1`, `arg2`)
- Indicate optional vs required in description
- Match order to positional arguments in command
- Keep concise but clear

**Examples by pattern:**

**Simple command:**
```yaml
---
description: Fix issue by number
argument-hint: [issue-number]
---

Fix issue #$1...
```

**Multi-argument:**
```yaml
---
description: Deploy to environment
argument-hint: [app-name] [environment] [version]
---

Deploy $1 to $2 using version $3...
```

**With options:**
```yaml
---
description: Run tests with options
argument-hint: [test-pattern] [options]
---

Run tests matching $1 with options: $2
```

### disable-model-invocation

**Type:** Boolean
**Required:** No
**Default:** false

**Purpose:** Prevent SlashCommand tool from programmatically invoking command

**Examples:**
```yaml
disable-model-invocation: true
```

**When to use:**

1. **Manual-only commands:** Commands requiring user judgment
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Approve deployment to production
   disable-model-invocation: true
   ---
   ```

2. **Destructive operations:** Commands with irreversible effects
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Delete all test data
   disable-model-invocation: true
   ---
   ```

3. **Interactive workflows:** Commands needing user input
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Walk through setup wizard
   disable-model-invocation: true
   ---
   ```

**Default behavior (false):**
- Command available to SlashCommand tool
- CrabCode can invoke programmatically
- Still available for manual invocation

**When true:**
- Command only invokable by user typing `/command`
- Not available to SlashCommand tool
- Safer for sensitive operations

**Best practices:**
- Use sparingly (limits CrabCode's autonomy)
- Document why in command comments
- Consider if command should exist if always manual

## Complete Examples

### Minimal Command

No frontmatter needed:

```markdown
Review this code for common issues and suggest improvements.
```

### Simple Command

Just description:

```markdown
---
description: Review code for issues
---

Review this code for common issues and suggest improvements.
```

### Standard Command

Description and tools:

```markdown
---
description: Review Git changes
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Read
---

Current changes: !`git diff --name-only`

Review each changed file for:
- Code quality
- Potential bugs
- Best practices
```

### Complex Command

All common fields:

```markdown
---
description: Deploy application to environment
argument-hint: [app-name] [environment] [version]
allowed-tools: Bash(kubectl:*), Bash(helm:*), Read
model: best
---

Deploy $1 to $2 environment using version $3

Pre-deployment checks:
- Verify $2 configuration
- Check cluster status: !`kubectl cluster-info`
- Validate version $3 exists

Proceed with deployment following deployment runbook.
```

### Manual-Only Command

Restricted invocation:

```markdown
---
description: Approve production deployment
argument-hint: [deployment-id]
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(gh:*)
---

<!--
MANUAL APPROVAL REQUIRED
This command requires human judgment and cannot be automated.
-->

Review deployment $1 for production approval:

Deployment details: !`gh api /deployments/$1`

Verify:
- All tests passed
- Security scan clean
- Stakeholder approval
- Rollback plan ready

Type "APPROVED" to confirm deployment.
```

## Validation

### Common Errors

**Invalid YAML syntax:**
```yaml
---
description: Missing quote
allowed-tools: Read, Write
model: inherit
---  # ❌ Missing closing quote above
```

**Fix:** Validate YAML syntax

**Incorrect tool specification:**
```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash  # ❌ Missing command filter
```

**Fix:** Use `Bash(git:*)` format

**Invalid model name:**
```yaml
model: gpt4  # ❌ Not a valid CrabCode model
```

**Fix:** Use `inherit`, `best`, or `planmode` — or a full model id from the
user's own catalog, though a shipped plugin should not assume one.

### Validation Checklist

Before committing command:
- [ ] YAML syntax valid (no errors)
- [ ] Description under 60 characters
- [ ] allowed-tools uses proper format
- [ ] model is valid value if specified
- [ ] argument-hint matches positional arguments
- [ ] disable-model-invocation used appropriately

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start minimal:** Add frontmatter only when needed
2. **Document arguments:** Always use argument-hint with arguments
3. **Restrict tools:** Use most restrictive allowed-tools that works
4. **Choose right model:** omit it to inherit; reserve `best` for genuinely complex work
5. **Manual-only sparingly:** Only use disable-model-invocation when necessary
6. **Clear descriptions:** Make commands discoverable in `/help`
7. **Test thoroughly:** Verify frontmatter works as expected
